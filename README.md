# Data Types & Operators  


### Exercise 1: Numbers

1.  Declare a number variable and assign an integer to it. Declare a variable 
and assign it a floating number.  
2.  Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,  modulus and 
exponentiation with a number variable and  another number.  
3.  Print all your variables.  
 
### Exercise 2: Boolean and Operators 

1.   Use comparison operators to compare two numbers and store the results 
in boolean variables.  
2.   Declare two variables x and y with the values 8 and 12 respectively.  
a.  Use comparison operators to check and print the following:  
b.  If x is greater than y.  
c.  If x is less than or equal to y.  
d.  If x is equal to y.  
e.  If x is not equal to y.  
3.  Declare the variables a and b with values true and false,  determine and print 
the result of the following logical  operations:  
a.  a AND b 
b.  a OR b  
c.  NOT a  
4.   Declare variable p and assign it a value of 10. Use the  following 
assignment operators to modify the value of p with any number and print 
the result each time:  
a.  +=  
b.   -=  
c.  *=  
d.  /=  
e.  %=  


## Conditional Statements & Loops  

### Exercise 1: Temperature check

1.  Write a code using if else statements to check the  temperature and print a 
message based on the following  conditions:  
a.  If the temperature is below 0, print "It's freezing!" 
b.  If the temperature is between 0 and 15, print "It's cold."  
c.  If the temperature is between 16 and 25, print "It's mild."  
d.  If the temperature is above 25, print "It's warm." 
2.   Re-write the code using switch Statements. 


### Exercise 2: Divisibility Check

1.   Write a code using if else statements to check if a  number is 
divisible by 2, 3, or both:  
a.  • If the number is divisible both by 2 and 3, print  
i.  "Divisible by both."  
b.  • If the number is divisible by only 2, print"Divisible by 2."  
c.  • If the number is divisible by only 3, print"Divisible by 3." 
d.  • If the number is not divisible by either, print "Not divisible by 2 or 
3."  
2.  Re-write the code using switch Statements. 
 
### Exercise 3: For loops

1.  Print numbers from 1 to 10.  
2.  Print all even numbers between 1 and 20.  
3.  Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 and print the result. Hint: ‘+=’  
4.  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Given the array of  numbers, print each 
element to the console.  
5.  const numbers = [3,7, 2, 5, 10, 6]. Given the array of numbers, find and print 
the largest number.  
#Hint: current value and previous value.  
 
### Exercise 4: While loops 

1.  Print numbers from 1 to 10.  
2.  Print all even numbers between 1 and 20.  
3.  Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 and print the result.  
4.  Print all multiples of 5 less than 50.  

Hint: ‘%’  
 
### Exercise 5: Do While loops  

1.  Print numbers from 1 to 10.  
2.  Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 and print the result.  
3.  Prompt the user to enter a number greater than 10. Keep asking until 
they enter a valid number. 
4.  Create a simple guessing game where the user must  guess a number 
between 1 and 10. The game continues until the user guesses the correct 
number.
